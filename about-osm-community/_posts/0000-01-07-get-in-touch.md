title: How to get in touch
---

As a decentralized project, there are many different ways to get in touch with the OpenStreetMap community, it depends on what you want to ask about.

The most formalized way is to contact the respective [Local Chapter](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Foundation/Local_Chapters#Active_local_chapters) where one exists.

The best way to meet people person to person are [local meetups](http://usergroups.openstreetmap.de/). You are highly likely to meet the mppers that have shaped the local map since years.

The quickest way to get answers are [local mailing lists](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/listinfo). Some countries use a message exchange system called [Forum](https://forum.openstreetmap.org/) instead. We suggest that you try the mailing list first and fall back to the forum if there are no answers on the mailing lists.

The [Working Groups]({{site.baseurl}}/about-osm-community/working-groups/) may cover your question if itâ€™s about a specific world-wide topic such as licensing or press inquiries.

Amongst the community itself very popular are [Changeset Discussions](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2014/11/02/introducing-changeset-discussions/). This is the best place to get an explanation why a specific place has been mapped the way it is.

If you need more help with contacting communities, try the [OSM contact channels](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Contact_channels){:target="_blank"} page. 

Here is [more information]({{site.baseurl}}/about-osm-community/donate-to-osm/) about donating to OSM.
